Pancini - Università di Napoli Federico II - I-80126 Napoli, Italy 4INFN, Sezione di Napoli - Complesso Universitario di Monte S. Angelo - I-80126 Napoli, Italy Report issue for preceding element AbstractReport issue for preceding element We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy—the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits—within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using advanced numerical techniques based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling continuous work extraction (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.Report issue for preceding element ††preprint: APS/123-QED I IntroductionReport issue for preceding element Ergotropy quantifies the maximum extractable average work from a closed quantum system under cyclic protocols Allahverdyan et al. (2004). For a system of dimension d𝑑ditalic_d, in a state ρ𝜌rhoitalic_ρ and described by a Hamiltonian H𝐻Hitalic_H, ergotropy can be defined asReport issue for preceding element ℰ=maxU∈𝒰⁢(d)⁡{tr⁢(H⁢ρ)−tr⁢(U⁢ρ⁢U†⁢H)},ℰsubscript𝑈𝒰𝑑tr𝐻𝜌tr𝑈𝜌superscript𝑈†𝐻mathcal{E}=max_{Uinmathcal{U}(d)}left{mathrm{tr}(Hrho)-mathrm{tr}(U% rho U^{dagger}H)right},,caligraphic_E = roman_max start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_U ∈ caligraphic_U ( italic_d ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT { roman_tr ( italic_H italic_ρ ) - roman_tr ( italic_U italic_ρ italic_U start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT † end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_H ) } , (1) where maxmaxroman_max denotes the maximum taken over all unitary transformations U𝑈Uitalic_U in the set of d𝑑ditalic_d-dimensional unitary operators 𝒰⁢(d)𝒰𝑑mathcal{U}(d)caligraphic_U ( italic_d ), which act on the entire system to extract work from it, and trtrmathrm{tr}roman_tr is the trace over the whole system. When the system S𝑆Sitalic_S is in contact with another system E𝐸Eitalic_E (environment) on which we do not have unitary control, one can define different ergotropic quantities. Hence, let the S⁢E𝑆𝐸SEitalic_S italic_E Hamiltonian be of the (general) formReport issue for preceding element HS⁢E=HS+HE+VS⁢E,subscript𝐻𝑆𝐸subscript𝐻𝑆subscript𝐻𝐸subscript𝑉𝑆𝐸H_{SE}=H_{S}+H_{E}+V_{SE},,italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , (2) where HSsubscript𝐻𝑆H_{S}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and HEsubscript𝐻𝐸H_{E}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are local terms on S𝑆Sitalic_S and E𝐸Eitalic_E and VS⁢Esubscript𝑉𝑆𝐸V_{SE}italic_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the interaction term. It is important to note that such a system can be viewed as an open quantum battery, as it interacts with the environment (open) and serves as the working principle from which one aims to extract work (quantum battery). In what follows, we will sometimes use “open quantum battery” and “system-environment” interchangeably for this reason. Given this context, there is increasing interest in studying the effects of the environment on work extraction. This includes both Markovian and non-Markovian effects, as discussed in Choquehuanca et al. (2024), and the environment’s influence on the remote charging of a quantum battery Song et al. (2024). Additionally, experimental works have presented possible implementations of many-body quantum batteries in superconducting devices Yang and Dou (2023). On one hand, we can think of first instantaneously turning off the coupling between S𝑆Sitalic_S and E𝐸Eitalic_E through a Hamiltonian quench (switch-off, “s⁢o𝑠𝑜soitalic_s italic_o”, protocol), paying an energy price Barra (2015); Ito and Miyadera (2017); Andolina et al.

The maximum extractable work through this procedure is then called the switch-off ergotropyReport issue for preceding element ℰs⁢o=ℰs⁢u⁢b−Δs⁢o.subscriptℰ𝑠𝑜subscriptℰ𝑠𝑢𝑏subscriptΔ𝑠𝑜mathcal{E}_{so}=mathcal{E}_{sub}-Delta_{so},.caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s italic_o end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s italic_u italic_b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s italic_o end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . (5) On the other hand, in presence of the coupling VS⁢Esubscript𝑉𝑆𝐸V_{SE}italic_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, we can directly extract work via local unitary transformations on S𝑆Sitalic_S. The concept of local ergotropy Salvia et al. (2023) formalizes this procedure. It is defined asReport issue for preceding element ℰS=maxUS∈𝒰⁢(dS)⁡{tr⁢(HS⁢E⁢ρS⁢E)−tr⁢(US⁢ρS⁢E⁢US†⁢HS⁢E)},subscriptℰ𝑆subscriptsubscript𝑈𝑆𝒰subscript𝑑𝑆trsubscript𝐻𝑆𝐸subscript𝜌𝑆𝐸trsubscript𝑈𝑆subscript𝜌𝑆𝐸superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑆†subscript𝐻𝑆𝐸mathcal{E}_{S}=max_{U_{S}inmathcal{U}(d_{S})}left{mathrm{tr}(H_{SE}rho% _{SE})-mathrm{tr}(U_{S}rho_{SE}U_{S}^{dagger}H_{SE})right},,caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = roman_max start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ caligraphic_U ( italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT { roman_tr ( italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - roman_tr ( italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT † end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) } , (6) where now the maximization is restricted to unitary operations that are local on S𝑆Sitalic_S. This automatically implies that local ergotropy is upper-bounded by the global ergotropy of the compound S⁢E𝑆𝐸SEitalic_S italic_E, i.e. ℰS≤ℰ⁢(ρS⁢E,HS⁢E)subscriptℰ𝑆ℰsubscript𝜌𝑆𝐸subscript𝐻𝑆𝐸mathcal{E}_{S}leqmathcal{E}(rho_{SE},H_{SE})caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≤ caligraphic_E ( italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). Notably, in several cases local ergotropy implies an advantage in work extraction when compared with the switch-off protocol Salvia et al. (2023) that can be further improved when properly exploiting the free dynamics of the S⁢E𝑆𝐸SEitalic_S italic_E compound Castellano et al. (2024). Here, we compare local ergotropy with the switch-off protocol as in Salvia et al. (2023), but we consider a realistic open system with a bath and perform continuous work extraction over time, since local ergotropy never reaches zero. Additionally, we aim to exploit the environment dynamics; however, unlike Castellano et al. (2024), we use local ergotropy and apply only one simple local unitary operation on the two-qubit system to extract work from it. Report issue for preceding element It is worth noting that, since we aim to exploit the environment dynamics to extract work from the system, we need to study the time-dependent behavior of the S⁢E𝑆𝐸SEitalic_S italic_E compound. One approach to this problem is to use Lindblad master equations to describe the system dynamics Farina et al. (2019). However, their validity is well known to be restricted by Markovian and weak-coupling assumptions Breuer and Petruccione (2002). To obtain a rigorous treatment, it is necessary to consider the full unitary dynamics of the S⁢E𝑆𝐸SEitalic_S italic_E system. This is achieved through state-of-the-art numerical simulations.Report issue for preceding element In the recent years connections between ergotropic quantities and many-body phenomena are attracting increasing interest Rossini et al. (2019, 2020); Zhao et al. (2021, 2022); Barra et al. (2022); Arjmandi et al. (2023); Grazi et al. (2024); Feliú and Barra (2024). Notably, it has been discovered that driving a system across a quantum phase transition (QPT) can enhance the energy stored in an XY spin chain quantum battery Grazi et al. (2024). Moreover, in a nearest-neighbor spin chain, ergotropy and energy storage exhibit a critical point reminiscent of the one dictated by the QPT, beyond which they significantly increase. In this framework, it is particularly relevant to understand if QPT can be beneficial for extracting work from open systems and, conversely, if ergotropic quantities can be used as witness of many-body phenomena in open systems. In particular, an analysis in this regard concerning the recently introduced notion of local ergotropy is still missing in the literature, even though some studies about work distribution across a QPT already exist Niu (2024). This is one of the objectives of the present investigation, which will focus on an environment-induced QPT belonging to the class of strong coupling Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions.Report issue for preceding element Another aspect we will analyze is the effect of the decoherence-free subspace (DFS) in engineering our open quantum battery. As we will show later, there is an eigenstate of our system S𝑆Sitalic_S that remains protected from environmental effects during its dynamics. We will attempt to exploit this protection to extract more work from the system. Similar attempts can be found in the literature, such as the work by Liu et al. Liu et al. (2019), which proposed the realization of a loss-free quantum battery by considering subspaces that are invariant with respect to the dynamics induced by the total Hamiltonian. However, extending this approach to many-body systems is not trivial. In this work, we provide such an extension in a specific model. Actually, developing a systematic approach to identify robust and energetically favorable relaxation-free subspaces in scalable many-body systems would be crucial Campaioli et al. (2024).Report issue for preceding element Specifically, we numerically study the behavior of local ergotropy and its fluctuations across the BKT QPT occurring in a two-qubit open quantum Rabi model. It has also been demonstrated that within the same model, by designating one qubit as the battery and the other as the charger, the presence of a QPT can be leveraged to achieve enhanced working performance Crescente et al. (2024). However, while previous studies treated the system with two baths at the Lindblad level, here we perform a numerically exact analysis considering the effect of a bath acting on the resonator of two interacting flux qubits. The second aim of this work is to propose a realistic protocol, describing charging, quasi-decoherence free storage and work extraction. We observe that the coupling to the bath is not detrimental to the local ergotropy; on the contrary, it increases as the coupling increases. By employing a local unitary gate based on the form of the ground state after the phase transition, we can approximately double the extractable work. We also demonstrate that the dynamics of local ergotropy and its fluctuations changes behavior once the QPT has occurred in the model. The features of this behavior, primarily due to the bath evolution, can be controlled by adjusting the local unitary gate used for work extraction.Report issue for preceding element The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the full Hamiltonian description of the system-environment compound, emphasizing relevant many-body phenomena characterizing the model, and presenting a concrete proposal for charging, storage and work extraction protocols. Section III presents our original numerical results regarding the relationship between ergotropic quantities and many-body phenomena. We describe the many-body state using a matrix product state (MPS) representation and employ density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) White (1992); Schollwöck (2011) simulations to determine the ground state of the Hamiltonian. Subsequently, we evolve this state using time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) Haegeman et al. (2011, 2016) numerical simulations. For both static and dynamic simulations we use ITensor library Fishman et al. (2022). We finally draw our conclusions in Sec.

This low-frequency behavior suggests the presence of a BKT QPT. Indeed, it has been proved De Filippis et al. (2023) that, after the elimination of the bosonic degrees of freedom, the system is mapped to a model of two classical spin chains ferromagnetically interacting with each other. This coupling, at long distances, exhibits a power-law behavior of 1/r21superscript𝑟21/r^{2}1 / italic_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, determined by the linear low-frequency regime of J⁢(ω)𝐽𝜔J(omega)italic_J ( italic_ω ).Report issue for preceding element We emphasize that this model depicts a realistic scenario wherein a bath interacts with two qubits through an oscillator featuring a Rabi interaction. A similar model has been proposed in Ref. Salvia et al. (2023), where a single qubit interacts with a single cavity through a Jaynes-Cummings coupling. This aims to describe a simple model in which local ergotropy is a better choice than the global one and the switch-off one, with this superiority increasing as the coupling with the oscillator becomes stronger. The time evolution of that model shows periodic oscillations of local ergotropy, with minima occurring at zero. In Ref. Castellano et al. (2024), the same model is used to test an extended local ergotropy definition, which never decreases over time and exploits the bath’s free evolution using a bang-bang protocol with repeated local unitary operations applied on the system. In our model, the presence of N𝑁Nitalic_N harmonic oscillators evolving with their phases over time deeply alters the amplitude of the local ergotropy and its fluctuations oscillations. Furthermore, the inclusion of counter-rotating terms, absent in the Jaynes-Cummings model, introduces a slight asymmetry in the oscillations, even when considering a single oscillator. It is also worth noting that the minima and maxima depend on the interaction strength J𝐽Jitalic_J. Choosing a high value for J𝐽Jitalic_J, as in this work, ensures that we can always extract work, never reaching a state of zero local ergotropy.Report issue for preceding element Decoherence-free state.—Report issue for preceding element In what follows it will be useful to look at the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian HSsubscript𝐻𝑆H_{S}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of the system alone.

In particular, some of us showed Di Bello et al. (2023); De Filippis et al. (2023) that the same model with two qubits (one in De Filippis et al. (2023)) undergoes a BKT phase transition at zero temperature. This is a ground-state QPT induced by the presence of dissipation. We found that the BKT transition occurs with increasing qubits-oscillator coupling g𝑔gitalic_g, while fixing the ferromagnetic interaction between the qubits at J=−10⁢Δ𝐽10ΔJ=-10Deltaitalic_J = - 10 roman_Δ. At a critical gc≈0.5⁢Δsubscript𝑔𝑐0.5Δg_{c}approx 0.5Deltaitalic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≈ 0.5 roman_Δ, the favored interaction becomes ferromagnetic and the ground state is degenerate.Report issue for preceding element Moreover, since we are also interested in the time behavior and want to find the unitary operator that makes the local ergotropy less dependent on time, or at least decreases it less over time, it’s worth recalling that this model also undergoes a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), as analyzed in Di Bello et al. (2023). This means that a particular critical time tcsubscript𝑡𝑐t_{c}italic_t start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be found at which the Loschmidt’s echo rate shows a kink, solely as a result of the coupling to the bath. The Loschmidt’s echo quantifies the probability of the system returning to its initial state after a quench in the parameters of the Hamiltonian, followed by its evolution under the quenched Hamiltonian. This happens for coupling g𝑔gitalic_g values in the same range as the thermodynamic QPT Di Bello et al. (2023), although there is generally no exact understanding of how they are related Heyl (2018).Report issue for preceding element We exploit the presence of the QPT in this system to design a local unitary gate for charging the two-qubit system. Our approach involves examining the ground state and choosing a strategy for local manipulation to induce charging. When the coupling to the bath is zero, the ground state is precisely |0⟩⊗|0,…,0⟩tensor-productket0ket0…0ket{0}otimesket{0,dots,0}| start_ARG 0 end_ARG ⟩ ⊗ | start_ARG 0 , … , 0 end_ARG ⟩, where |0⟩ket0ket{0}| start_ARG 0 end_ARG ⟩ is the ground state of the closed two-qubit system in (10). However, after the BKT QPT occurs, the system must be in one of the two degenerate states, namely |↑↑⟩ket↑absent↑ket{uparrowuparrow}| start_ARG ↑ ↑ end_ARG ⟩ or |↓↓⟩ket↓absent↓ket{downarrowdownarrow}| start_ARG ↓ ↓ end_ARG ⟩, along with a configuration of the bath modes De Filippis et al. (2023); Di Bello et al. (2023). On the other hand, near the QPT, it can be expressed as a linear combination of these two possibilities:Report issue for preceding element |ψG⁢S⟩=α⁢|↑↑⟩⊗|B↑⟩+β⁢|↓↓⟩⊗|B↓⟩,ketsubscript𝜓𝐺𝑆tensor-product𝛼ket↑absent↑ketsubscript𝐵↑tensor-product𝛽ket↓absent↓ketsubscript𝐵↓ket{psi_{GS}}=alphaket{uparrowuparrow}otimesket{B_{uparrow}}+beta% ket{downarrowdownarrow}otimesket{B_{downarrow}},,| start_ARG italic_ψ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_G italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ⟩ = italic_α | start_ARG ↑ ↑ end_ARG ⟩ ⊗ | start_ARG italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ↑ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ⟩ + italic_β | start_ARG ↓ ↓ end_ARG ⟩ ⊗ | start_ARG italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ↓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ⟩ , (14) where |B↑⟩ketsubscript𝐵↑ket{B_{uparrow}}| start_ARG italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ↑ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ⟩ and |B↓⟩ketsubscript𝐵↓ket{B_{downarrow}}| start_ARG italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ↓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ⟩ represent potentially complex combinations of coherent states associated with the two degenerate states of the subsystem. The coefficients α𝛼alphaitalic_α and β𝛽betaitalic_β quantify the deviation of the state from that at critical coupling.Report issue for preceding element II.2 Charging, storage and work extractionReport issue for preceding element To design a suitable charged state, we looked at the closed Hamiltonian eigenvectors (10) and construct an ad-hoc local unitary transformation (change of basis) acting on the qubits that could exploit a semi-DFS Di Bello et al. (2024). As discussed, the singlet state remains resilient to the influence of the bath, making it insensitive to decoherence. In what follows we will exploit then the semi-DFS when the system is in a state that is very close to |S⟩ket𝑆ket{S}| start_ARG italic_S end_ARG ⟩ once charged.Report issue for preceding element II.2.1 Discharged stateReport issue for preceding element We begin by determining the ground state |ψG⁢S⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝐺𝑆ket{psi_{GS}}| start_ARG italic_ψ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_G italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ⟩ ((14)) of the entire Hamiltonian H𝐻Hitalic_H, our discharged state, using the DMRG algorithm.

This approach allows us to transition from the strong coupling regime to the ultrastrong coupling one. Once the transition occurs, the subsystem must to be only in the |↑↑⟩ket↑absent↑ket{uparrowuparrow}| start_ARG ↑ ↑ end_ARG ⟩ state. We construct a transformation such that, in this case, the effect of the local operator is to bring the system into the singlet state alone. On the other hand, when β𝛽betaitalic_β is non-zero (for coupling g𝑔gitalic_g below the critical point), the system can be written as a superposition of the two states (Eq. (14)). In this scenario, after applying the local operator on the ground state, the resultant state is not an exact eigenstate of the entire Hamiltonian, and the interaction with the environment is not zero, leading to temporal evolution. This state can be characterized as a semi-DFS, as it is in a combination of the singlet state and the most excited one (|2⟩ket2ket{2}| start_ARG 2 end_ARG ⟩ and |3⟩ket3ket{3}| start_ARG 3 end_ARG ⟩ in (10)). Only in the strongly ordered phase post-QPT the two-qubit system is in the exact DFS, protected from external perturbations, while the bath keeps evolving, described by a superposition of coherent states. However, in this case, the interaction with the system does not affect the bath dynamics.Report issue for preceding element II.2.2 ChargingReport issue for preceding element As mentioned above, our protocol is based on the use of the DFS. Note that for this value of the two-qubit interaction strength J𝐽Jitalic_J, it is very high in energy, allowing us to extract a significant amount of energy from it. The idea is to bring the state of the subsystem as close as possible to the DFS to protect the dynamics from the bath.

(18) From the computational point of view, we allow the system to evolve with the entire Hamiltonian using TDVP numerical simulations. Following the application of the unitary operator in (15), the system is in a semi-DFS state. Consequently, the two-qubit system remains in a quasi-singlet state throughout the evolution, maintaining its energy constant. However, the bath undergoes evolution, causing changes in the state of the entire Hamiltonian. This evolution is the underlying reason for the degradation of ergotropy over time.Report issue for preceding element II.2.4 Local work extractionReport issue for preceding element Local work extraction at t=0𝑡0t=0italic_t = 0.—Report issue for preceding element In the absence of a storage phase (t=0𝑡0t=0italic_t = 0), by applying the local unitary operator US(c)†U_{S}^{(c)}{}^{dagger}italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_c ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT † end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT on S𝑆Sitalic_S, the whole compound S⁢E𝑆𝐸SEitalic_S italic_E goes back to the ground state, by only acting on the two-qubit subsystem.

(20) On this regard, we notice that in general, at variance with ergotropy (1), an analytic expression for local ergotropy (6) is only known for the single qubit case Salvia et al. (2023). As a consequence, for t>0𝑡0t>0italic_t > 0 the exact value of the local ergotropy ℰS⁢(t)subscriptℰ𝑆𝑡mathcal{E}_{S}(t)caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_t ) is not known.

As discussed previously, in our protocol, the exact form of the two-qubit unitary operator allowing to saturate (22) is only known at time t=0𝑡0t=0italic_t = 0. For times t>0𝑡0t>0italic_t > 0 we then present two different approaches. Since the charged system is in a semi-DFS, we can try to extract work at time t>0𝑡0t>0italic_t > 0 with the same unitary gate US(c)†U_{S}^{(c)}{}^{dagger}italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_c ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT † end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT that was optimal at t=0𝑡0t=0italic_t = 0. We call this agnostic approach and the corresponding analysis is reported in Sec. III.2.1. The second approach, detailed in Sec. III.2.2, consists in what follows. For any given time t>0𝑡0t>0italic_t > 0, we perform optimizations with different tools obtaining lower bounds ℰ~S⁢(t)subscript~ℰ𝑆𝑡\tilde{mathcal{E}}_{S}(t)over~ start_ARG caligraphic_E end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_t ) that, if compared with the agnostic protocol, are closer to the optimal value ℰS⁢(t)subscriptℰ𝑆𝑡mathcal{E}_{S}(t)caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_t ).Report issue for preceding element Work fluctuations.—Report issue for preceding element We also compute the work fluctuations. On one hand, this is to assess if they can be more sensitive to the presence of phase transitions. On the other hand, from the technological point of view we want them to be not too large in order to obtain a suitable precision in work extraction. We notice that the charged state |ψS⁢E⁢(t)⟩⁢⟨ψS⁢E⁢(t)|ketsubscript𝜓𝑆𝐸𝑡brasubscript𝜓𝑆𝐸𝑡ket{psi_{SE}(t)}bra{psi_{SE}(t)}| start_ARG italic_ψ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_t ) end_ARG ⟩ ⟨ start_ARG italic_ψ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_t ) end_ARG |, Eq. (16), does not commute with the compound’s Hamiltonian HS⁢Esubscript𝐻𝑆𝐸H_{SE}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. This implies that a two-point measurement (TPM) scheme Esposito et al. (2009) cannot describe the average value of the work extraction, as, e.g., provided by the local ergotropy when considering the maximization as in (6) (Perarnau-Llobet et al., 2017). Indeed, it is well-known that the TPM scheme is invasive, in the sense that the first measurement of the energy destroys the initial coherence in the energy basis and this coherence generally represents a resource for work extraction. In this sense, quasiprobability distribution approaches are a useful tool to overcome this issue, providing a way to describe the work average – in our case, correctly yielding Eq.

We compute local ergotropy (coinciding with the total ergotropy and energy excitation) along with its relative fluctuations and switch-off ergotropy for increasing values of g𝑔gitalic_g, as illustrated in Fig. 1.Report issue for preceding element Figure 1: Charging capability of the model: local (red circle) and switch-off (blue triangle) ergotropy for increasing g/Δ𝑔Δg/Deltaitalic_g / roman_Δ, at time t=0𝑡0t=0italic_t = 0, that is without a storage phase. In the inset we report the relative work fluctuations associated to the local ergotropy as a function of g/Δ𝑔Δg/Deltaitalic_g / roman_Δ. We set the parameters as follows: ω0=Δsubscript𝜔0Δomega_{0}=Deltaitalic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = roman_Δ, J=−10⁢Δ𝐽10ΔJ=-10Deltaitalic_J = - 10 roman_Δ, α=0.1𝛼0.1alpha=0.1italic_α = 0.1, and ωc=30⁢Δsubscript𝜔𝑐30Δomega_{c}=30Deltaitalic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 30 roman_Δ, with ΔΔDeltaroman_Δ serving as the unit. Additionally, we employ DMRG to determine the ground state as an MPS with N=300𝑁300N=300italic_N = 300 bath oscillators and a cutoff of n=7𝑛7n=7italic_n = 7 for the Hilbert space of each oscillator. We ensure the convergence of the DMRG results by performing 10101010 sweeps and controlling the minimum and maximum bond dimensions, the truncation error, the number of exact diagonalizations per sweep, and the noise term added to the density matrix. Report issue for preceding element The numerical results indicate that local ergotropy nearly doubles its switch-off counterpart (see Appendix C for details on its computation) as g𝑔gitalic_g increases, and it remains insensitive to the QPT occurring around g≈0.5⁢Δ𝑔0.5Δgapprox 0.5Deltaitalic_g ≈ 0.5 roman_Δ. This firstly shows how the coupling to the environment is not detrimental to the work extraction, although it doesn’t serve as a marker for the transition. This aligns with the BKT transition’s infinite order nature, which implies non-analyticities in any derivative of complex system functions, rather than in energy. However, the growth of local ergotropy with g𝑔gitalic_g implicitly depends on the QPT presence. The closer the system is to the critical gcsubscript𝑔𝑐g_{c}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, the closer its state is to the singlet after applying the unitary gate. The inset of Fig. 1 shows relative fluctuations, namely the ratio between the work standard deviation σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ and the average extractable work ℰSsubscriptℰ𝑆mathcal{E}_{S}caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, of ergotropy exhibiting a change in concavity, proving sensitivity to the QPT. Additionally, we highlight that the switch-off ergotropy value is dominated by the subsystem ergotropy contribution ℰs⁢u⁢bsubscriptℰ𝑠𝑢𝑏mathcal{E}_{sub}caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s italic_u italic_b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (Eq. (4)). Furthermore, it is approximately on the order of the energy difference between the ground state and the most excited state of the closed system in Eq. (10), meaning we are extracting the maximum energy from the two-qubit system. Specifically, for very large negative J𝐽Jitalic_J, such as in our case, this value is on the order of −J/2≈5⁢Δ𝐽25Δ-J/2approx 5Delta- italic_J / 2 ≈ 5 roman_Δ.Report issue for preceding element III.2 Storage and work extraction featuresReport issue for preceding element We allow the system to evolve with the entire Hamiltonian (see Eqs. (17) and (18)) and evaluate the work extraction capabilities as function of time.Report issue for preceding element III.2.1 Agnostic approach for work extractionReport issue for preceding element We initially present the results concerning the extractable work via the constant unitary gate US(c)†U_{S}^{(c)}{}^{dagger}italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_c ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT † end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, namely the inverse of the charging unitary operator (15), as a function of the storage time. In particular, we plot in Fig. 2 the time evolution of the lower bound of the local ergotropy ℰ~(US(c))†\tilde{mathcal{E}}(U_{S}^{(c)}{}^{dagger})over~ start_ARG caligraphic_E end_ARG ( italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_c ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT † end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ) and the switch-off ergotropy ℰs⁢osubscriptℰ𝑠𝑜{mathcal{E}}_{so}caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s italic_o end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as functions of t𝑡titalic_t for increasing values of g𝑔gitalic_g, crossing the critical value gc≈0.5⁢Δsubscript𝑔𝑐0.5Δg_{c}approx 0.5Deltaitalic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≈ 0.5 roman_Δ. ℰs⁢o⁢(t)subscriptℰ𝑠𝑜𝑡{mathcal{E}}_{so}(t)caligraphic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s italic_o end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_t ) is almost constant both in t𝑡titalic_t and in g𝑔gitalic_g and, importantly, non-zero as a consequence of the fact that the charged state is quasi-decoherence free and J𝐽Jitalic_J having a large absolute value. We observe that, as a consequence of a coherent interaction with the bath, the local ergotropy lower bound oscillates around the corresponding switch-off ergotropy, allowing one to obtain an improvement for long times. It’s worth noting that the period T𝑇Titalic_T of these oscillations depends on the parameters of the system and can be adjusted by changing ω0subscript𝜔0omega_{0}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT since it is T≈2⁢π/ω0𝑇2𝜋subscript𝜔0Tapprox 2pi/omega_{0}italic_T ≈ 2 italic_π / italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for couplings g≥gc𝑔subscript𝑔𝑐ggeq g_{c}italic_g ≥ italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Additionally, the maxima and minima of the oscillations can be understood in terms of the in-phase and counter-phase behaviors of the bath oscillators. Our unitary gate takes the system in the semi-DFS ensuring that the two-qubit system does not interact with the bath, allowing the bath oscillators to evolve with their phase factors at frequencies near ω0subscript𝜔0omega_{0}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Consequently, the primary oscillation frequency is ω0subscript𝜔0omega_{0}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. At time zero, there’s a maximum due to constructive interference among the bath oscillators, whereas after half a period, they are in phase opposition, resulting in a minimum local ergotropy. Subsequently, at every t=2⁢k⁢π/ω0𝑡2𝑘𝜋subscript𝜔0t=2kpi/omega_{0}italic_t = 2 italic_k italic_π / italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with k∈ℤ𝑘ℤkinmathbb{Z}italic_k ∈ roman_ℤ, a relative maximum occurs. The values of the maxima decrease over time due to the large number N𝑁Nitalic_N of harmonic oscillators. Once it becomes impossible to extract more energy from the two-qubit system using the bath energy, the local ergotropy remains at the switch-off level. It’s important to note that it never reaches zero.Report issue for preceding element Additionally, reducing the bath cutoff frequency ωcsubscript𝜔𝑐omega_{c}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to the system energy scale introduces non-Markovian effects, increasing the period, as it renormalizes the oscillator frequency filtering the frequencies above it in the bath spectrum. This feature can be utilized to engineer the protocol as needed.Report issue for preceding element Figure 2: Lower bound of local ergotropy (solid lines) obtained using the agnostic protocol described in Sec. III.2.1, as function of dimensionless time, for increasing g/Δ𝑔Δg/Deltaitalic_g / roman_Δ (from red to orange). We also report the switch-off ergotropy averaging over the almost constant values obtained for different g/Δ𝑔Δg/Deltaitalic_g / roman_Δ (black dashed line).

We ensure the convergence of the DMRG results by performing 10101010 sweeps and controlling the minimum and maximum bond dimensions, the truncation error, the number of exact diagonalizations per sweep, and the noise term added to the density matrix.

A distinct behavior is observable between the low-g𝑔gitalic_g curves and those beyond the critical g𝑔gitalic_g, attributed to the presence of the QPT and the effect of the counter-rotating terms in the Rabi model, becoming more significant as g𝑔gitalic_g increases. Notably, a maximum emerges for high g𝑔gitalic_g values, occurring when the bath is for the first time in counter-phase, farthest from its initial state. The maxima in the relative fluctuations behavior coincide with the bath being in counter-phase, corresponding to minima in local ergotropy.Report issue for preceding element To summarize, the change of the behavior with increasing g𝑔gitalic_g can be observed in both local ergotropy and relative fluctuations, due to the presence of the QPT.

Hence, under the ansatz (24), for any time t𝑡titalic_t we assess the maximum of the local extractable work (still representing a lower bound for local ergotropy) by varying θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ and ϕitalic-ϕphiitalic_ϕ over an equally spaced grid, and picking the best values (θ¯⁢(t),ϕ¯⁢(t))¯𝜃𝑡¯italic-ϕ𝑡(bar{\theta}(t),bar{phi}(t))( over¯ start_ARG italic_θ end_ARG ( italic_t ) , over¯ start_ARG italic_ϕ end_ARG ( italic_t ) ). Finally, to test the quality of the local ergotropy lower bound based on the considered ansatz, we explore the optimum work extraction achievable by applying random Haar-distributed unitaries on the two-qubit system and maximizing the extractable work at any given time t𝑡titalic_t. This allows us to quantify how far our results are from those obtained using random distributions.

The optimization is performed by varying θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ and ϕitalic-ϕphiitalic_ϕ in (24) over an equally spaced grid. As in Fig. 2, this represents a lower bound for local ergotropy, but an improvement with respect to the green curve in Fig. 2 corresponding to the same g𝑔gitalic_g value. We also report the result obtained via an optimization drawing 100 random (converging over the average) Haar unitary operations (blue dashed line) and picking the one corresponding to the greatest local extractable work. The black dotted curve is the switch-off ergotropy. We set the parameters as follows: ω0=Δsubscript𝜔0Δomega_{0}=Deltaitalic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = roman_Δ, J=−10⁢Δ𝐽10ΔJ=-10Deltaitalic_J = - 10 roman_Δ, α=0.1𝛼0.1alpha=0.1italic_α = 0.1, and ωc=30⁢Δsubscript𝜔𝑐30Δomega_{c}=30Deltaitalic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 30 roman_Δ, with ΔΔDeltaroman_Δ serving as the unit.

We extract work after applying the local unitary gate (24) on the MPS for the ansatz and the optimized one for the Haar distribution. Report issue for preceding element Figure 4 demonstrates that, once optimized over θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ and ϕitalic-ϕphiitalic_ϕ, the ansatz unitary gate (24) (red solid line) consistently outperforms the Haar unitaries (blue dashed line). This shows that our physically inspired ansatz lies among the outliers of a random Haar unitaries distribution. Knowing the phase diagram of this model helped us to find a simple and efficient ansatz for work extraction. It is worth noting that we choose to show only the case for g=0.6⁢Δ>gc𝑔0.6Δsubscript𝑔𝑐g=0.6Delta>g_{c}italic_g = 0.6 roman_Δ > italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, to ensure that the charging unitary gate mapped the ground state to the DFS. However, a similar behavior would be observed if considering g≈gc𝑔subscript𝑔𝑐gapprox g_{c}italic_g ≈ italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, but with reduced maxima and the addition of a superoscillation with a frequency related to the two-qubit energy ΔΔDeltaroman_Δ. Interestingly, oscillations persist depending on the oscillator and the bath parameters, but the extractable work now, at variance with the agnostic protocol, is always above or on the order of the switch-off ergotropy. This suggests that we are effectively rephasing the bath, transforming minima into maxima and thereby extending the time intervals during which we gain compared to the switch-off protocol. Furthermore, the ansatz approaches the switch-off ergotropy at long times (black dots). This indicates that over time, the advantage of interactions with the environment diminishes as it reaches equilibrium, far from the initial state, but the local ergotropy never reaches zero as well. We also compute the relative fluctuations for the lower bound of the local ergotropy (Fig. 5), observing no transition markers but cutting the maximum as we approach the critical g𝑔gitalic_g. This is attributed to the presence of maxima instead of minima in the optimized lower bound of local ergotropy. Moreover, the fluctuations using random Haar matrices are always greater than the ones obtained through the physically inspired ansatz.Report issue for preceding element In Appendix D we present average and standard deviation statistics for Haar unitaries compared with the ansatz, further confirming the efficacy of the latter, which stands at 2.52.52.52.5 standard deviations from the Haar average. Interestingly, in Appendix E, we describe another method we adopt to optimize the ergotropy. We use a Bayesian optimization approach over a unitary operator not very far from the optimized ansatz one, obtaining similar results with only a 1%percent11%1 % improvement. These results are thus not shown in the paper.Report issue for preceding element Figure 5: Relative work fluctuations associated to the lower bound of the local ergotropy reported in Fig. 4, as a function of dimensionless time, for g/Δ=0.6𝑔Δ0.6g/Delta=0.6italic_g / roman_Δ = 0.6.

III.2.2 based on the ansatz (24) (red solid line) and drawing 100 random (converging over the average) Haar unitary operations (blue dashed line) and picking the one corresponding to the greatest local ergotropy.

Report issue for preceding element IV ConclusionsReport issue for preceding element We compute local ergotropy and its relative fluctuations in the two-qubit open Rabi model and implement a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, demonstrating its application as an open quantum battery. Our findings indicate that interaction with the external environment enhances, rather than hinders, work extraction. Specifically, increased coupling to an external bath doubles the local ergotropy immediately after system charging. Furthermore, when comparing local ergotropy with switch-off ergotropy, the former is approximately twice the latter. Indeed, the switch-off ergotropy considers the interaction with the environment only through the energy required to switch it off.Report issue for preceding element We observed that even though local ergotropy seems to be insensitive to the phase transition, always increasing with increasing g𝑔gitalic_g (see Fig. 1), this increase is due to the ad-hoc construction of the local unitary operation for charging, tailored to the ground state of the system in the presence of the transition. Additionally, our model exploits the DFS, achieved through a local unitary operation during charging, providing protection from external interactions during storage.Report issue for preceding element Dynamic analysis revealed oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations (see Figs. 2 and 3), with frequencies tied to the two-qubit system and the coupling cavity, allowing further tuning of the quantum battery. These oscillations, influenced by the phase transition, underscore the intricate link between phase transitions and ergotropy. Moreover, we prove that local ergotropy during long time intervals exceeds switch-off ergotropy by exploiting coherent interaction with the bath.Report issue for preceding element By optimizing the discharge process through a physically inspired ansatz (see Figs. 4 and 5), we achieved superior local ergotropy compared to switch-off ergotropy over time, approaching the switch-off ergotropy for long times, but never reaching zero.Report issue for preceding element Finally, it is worth estimating the size of the time windows we have analyzed in this work to understand if they can be resolved experimentally with current technology. This relies on factors such as the energy of an ultrastrongly coupled flux superconducting qubit device, which typically operates at several gigahertz. For instance, with 20⁢t⁢Δ≈25⁢n⁢s20𝑡Δ25𝑛𝑠20tDeltaapprox 25ns20 italic_t roman_Δ ≈ 25 italic_n italic_s, or by explicitly accounting for relaxation rates observed in devices reaching high coupling regimes. These rates are often estimated using the Lindblad approach and should be comparable to the previously estimated values.Report issue for preceding element Our work demonstrates a feasible, experimentally tunable protocol for work extraction, reinforcing the connection between BKT QPT and ergotropy, and identifying quantities sensitive to such transitions. Future research could explore the application of our protocol to larger systems, investigating the impact of various environmental interactions on ergotropy and phase transitions to provide deeper insights into the practical implementation of open quantum batteries.Report issue for preceding element ReferencesReport issue for preceding element Allahverdyan et al.

(42) It should be remarked that the resulting subspace is effectively single-qubit and therefore the most general unitary depends on three parameters (i.e., one more angle). However, we have numerical evidence that considering three parameters yields no substantial differences and, for this reason, we choose to report the simpler ansatz with only two angles to optimize over. .

At time t+τ𝑡𝜏t+\tauitalic_t + italic_τ, this driving results, in our case, in the application of the local unitary operator to the system’s state as described in (6). It should be noticed that in the definition of local ergotropy, τ𝜏\tauitalic_τ is assumed to be arbitrarily small (see e.g. discussions in (Castellano et al., 2024)).

We ensure the convergence of the DMRG results by performing 10101010 sweeps and controlling the minimum and maximum bond dimensions, the truncation error, the number of exact diagonalizations per sweep, and the noise term added to the density matrix.

We extract work after applying the local unitary gate (24) on the MPS for the ansatz and the optimized one for the Haar distribution. Report issue for preceding element We compare the range of variability in the distribution of Haar matrices used to optimize local work extraction (as discussed in Sec. III.2.2) with the lower bound of local ergotropy obtained through the ansatz (24) for the unitary operation that extracts work from the system. Specifically, in Fig. 7, the average extractable work (another lower bound of local ergotropy) for Haar matrices is depicted as a blue dashed line, while the shaded region represents one standard deviation, indicating the range of variability in the distribution. The red curve corresponding to the ansatz (24) lies outside two standard deviations.

Based on dimensional estimates of the relevant parameters, we conclude that (as conventionally assumed) phonons are negligible in traditional semiconductor quantum well systems, but likely play a significant role in various recently synthesized atomically thin two-dimensional materials.Report issue for preceding element I IntroductionReport issue for preceding element The Fermi Liquid (FL) to Wigner Crystal (WC) transition reflects the the competition between the kinetic and Coulomb interaction energies in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The Coulomb interaction dominates at large average inter-electron spacing when the electrons spontaneously crystallize into a WC. Since the initial proposal of its existence 80 years ago ([1]), enormous efforts, numerical/ theoretical [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and experimental [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] , have been devoted to pin down the exact properties of the WC phase and the transition as a function of the 2D electron density nesubscript𝑛𝑒n_{e}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.Report issue for preceding element Even weak quenched disorder is known to destroy long-range WC order in 2D, but if the disorder is weak enough, the physics of the ideal clean limit can still be relevant. Recent progress in experimental techniques has made atomically thin two-dimensional materials of increasingly high mobility available that presumably mean low disorder. This is consistent with multiple reports of realization of WC phases in these platforms (either pristine or moiré)[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Theoretical studies specifically targeted at these new atomically thin platforms include [26, 27, 28]Report issue for preceding element The FL to WC transition has typically been treated as a purely electronic problem. The underlying ion lattice where the electron gas lives is thus neglected. In this paper, we address the importance of electron-phonon coupling in determining the FL-WC phase transition.

In Fig.1, starting from values of the energy of the FL and WC states in the absence of elecron-phonon coupling taken from state of the art variational Monte-Carlo calculations[2], we show the shift in the relative energy that would result from N0subscript𝑁0N_{0}italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in this range, and assuming a value of E0=Ry∗subscript𝐸0superscriptRyE_{0}=\text{Ry}^{*}italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = Ry start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. Clearly, the change in the critical rssubscript𝑟𝑠r_{s}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is significant. For instance, for N0=1000subscript𝑁01000N_{0}=1000italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 1000, the critical rssubscript𝑟𝑠r_{s}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for the transition from a ferromagnetic WC to a paramagnetic FL is shifted from rs=32.89subscript𝑟𝑠32.89r_{s}=32.89italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 32.89[2] to rs=12.78subscript𝑟𝑠12.78r_{s}=12.78italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 12.78!Report issue for preceding element III.2 The extent of microemulsion phasesReport issue for preceding element In principle, macroscopic phase separation is precluded in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. Rather than a direct first order transition between the FL and the WC, there should arise an intermediate phase or phases - most likely microemulsion phases [37, 38]. However, it was pointed out in Ref.[35] that for the pure 2DEG, this intermediate phase is expected to be extremely narrow, due to the fact that the difference in the chemical potential between the two extremal phases, δ⁢μ𝛿𝜇deltamuitalic_δ italic_μ, appears (from the numerics) to be so small. Specifically, in the same paper, an approximate upper bound on the range of density, δ⁢n𝛿𝑛delta nitalic_δ italic_n, of the microemulsion phases was found to beReport issue for preceding element δ⁢nnc≲3⁢π16⁢rs⁢δ⁢μRy∗less-than-or-similar-to𝛿𝑛subscript𝑛𝑐3𝜋16subscript𝑟𝑠𝛿𝜇superscriptRyfrac{delta n}{n_{c}}lesssimfrac{3sqrt{pi}}{16} r_{s} frac{deltamu}{% \text{Ry}^{*}}divide start_ARG italic_δ italic_n end_ARG start_ARG italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ≲ divide start_ARG 3 square-root start_ARG italic_π end_ARG end_ARG start_ARG 16 end_ARG italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_δ italic_μ end_ARG start_ARG Ry start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG (12) where ncsubscript𝑛𝑐n_{c}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the critical electron density at the FL-WC transition.Report issue for preceding element Notably, as is apparent from Fig. 1, the electron-phonon effects can substantially increase δ⁢μ𝛿𝜇deltamuitalic_δ italic_μ.

Even for relatively large N0subscript𝑁0N_{0}italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, there is a significant enhancemnt, albeit not large enough to account for the range of microemulsion phases reported in experiment, e.g. δ⁢nnc∼O⁢(1)similar-to𝛿𝑛subscript𝑛𝑐𝑂1frac{delta n}{n_{c}}sim O(1)divide start_ARG italic_δ italic_n end_ARG start_ARG italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ∼ italic_O ( 1 ) in Ref. [21].Report issue for preceding element IV DiscussionReport issue for preceding element In this article, we have carried through an initial (perturbative) study of the importance of electron-phonon coupling on the thermodynamic properties of the 2DEG proximate to the FL to WC transition. For circumstances characteristic of the 2DEG in semiconductor quantum wells, we found that because the typical electronic wave-functions are spread out over so many unit cells of the underlying crystal, the effects of electron-phonon coupling are negligible. However, for parameters characteristic of novel 2D materials, at the very least the critical value of rssubscript𝑟𝑠r_{s}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is expected to be significantly shifted (to smaller values) by the coupling to phonons. We also find a corresponding phonon-induced enhancement of the stability of intermediate microemulsion phases, although it is unclear whether this effect can be large enough to account for recent reported observations of these phases.Report issue for preceding element There are several further refinements of the theory presented here that may be worth pursuing. In the first place, when the shift of the critical rssubscript𝑟𝑠r_{s}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is substantial, the approximations we have employed may no longer be reliable - both treating the WC structure factor in harmonic approximation (which is less well justified for smaller rssubscript𝑟𝑠r_{s}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and treating the electron-phonon coupling perturbativey. Secondly, the adiabatic approximation, valid when the phonon frequencies Ω𝒒,rsubscriptΩ𝒒𝑟Omega_{bm{q},r}roman_Ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_q , italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are small compared to the characteristic electron frequencies, ∼Ry∗/rssimilar-toabsentsuperscriptRysubscript𝑟𝑠sim\text{Ry}^{*}/sqrt{r_{s}}∼ Ry start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT / square-root start_ARG italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG, may breakdown in some circumstances. In Appendix C we obtain a formal expression for δ⁢E𝛿𝐸delta Eitalic_δ italic_E to second order in the electron-phonon coupling including the effects of dynamical phonon ground-state fluctuations. However, we have not systematically explored the effect of these terms. Finally, there may be circumstances in which our crude dimensional estimate of the strength of the electron-phonon coupling may underestimate the effect of particularly strongly coupled phonon modes.Report issue for preceding element Finally, to be directly relevant to experiment, the effects of finite temperature and of effects of the underlying lattice beyond the effective mass approximation (including the possibility of commensurate locking to the underlying lattice) need to be considered.Report issue for preceding element Acknowledgements: We acknowledge useful conversations with Z.Y.

Valldemossa km 7.5, E-07122 Palma, Spain Physik-Institut, Universität Zürich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057 Zürich, Switzerland Report issue for preceding element (August 5, 2024) AbstractReport issue for preceding element Accurate waveform modelling is crucial for parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy, impacting our understanding of source properties and the testing of general relativity. The precession of orbital and spin angular momenta in binary black hole (BBH) systems with misaligned spins presents a complex challenge for gravitational waveform modelling. Current precessing BBH waveform models employ a co-precessing frame, which precesses along with the binary. In this paper, we investigate a source of bias stemming from the mismodelling of ringdown frequency in the co-precessing frame. We find that this mismodelling of the co-precessing frame ringdown frequency introduces systematic biases in parameter estimation, for high mass systems in particular, and in the Inspiral-Merger-Ringdown (IMR)-consistency test of general relativity. Employing the waveform model IMRPhenomXPHM, we conduct an IMR-consistency test using a Fisher matrix analysis across parameter space, as well as full injected signal parameter estimation studies. Our results show that this mismodelling particularly affects BBH systems with high mass ratios, high spin magnitudes, and highly inclined spins. These findings suggest inconsistencies for all waveform models which do not address this issue.Report issue for preceding element ††preprint: APS/123-QED I IntroductionReport issue for preceding element Since the first detection of gravitational waves (GWs) in 2015, 90 GW events have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK), primarily originating from binary black hole (BBH) systems [1, 2, 3, 4]. These systems, composed of two black holes orbiting around each other, emit GWs as they lose orbital energy, gradually spiralling towards each other before merging into a single, perturbed black hole. GWs contain information of the astrophysical systems that produced them, such as the masses and spins of the black holes, and can also be used to test our physical theory of general relativity (GR).Report issue for preceding element Parameter estimation, a process to extract properties of the source from GWs, relies on comparing accurate theoretical waveforms with GW data. Systematic errors in theoretical waveforms can introduce biases in parameter estimation [5, 6, 7]. The increasing sensitivity of current detectors, in particular the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors [8, 9, 10, 11], and the construction of next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer [12, 13], Einstein Telescope [14] and LISA [15], underscore the need for more precise waveform models. Current BBH waveform models used by the LVK can be split into three families, the phenomenological models “Phenom” [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], the effective-one-body models “SEOBNR” [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], and the numerical relativity surrogate models “NRSurrogate” [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46].Report issue for preceding element GW signals from BBHs on quasi-circular orbits are characterised by the masses and spins of the binary. Modelling efforts are complicated by eccentricity and spin effects. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the effects of black hole spins with components in the orbital plane of the binary. The orientation of spins in generic BBH systems can vary widely, depending on their formation process [47, 48]. When the spins of the two black holes in a binary are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum, both the orbital and spin angular momenta will precess about the total orbital angular momentum, a phenomenon known as (spin) precession [49, 50, 51]. This results in intricate modulations of both the amplitude and phase of the GW signal, which are difficult to model [52, 53]. Waveform models for precessing BBHs usually employ a co-precessing frame, which precesses along with the binary. In this frame the waveform is well approximated by an aligned-spin waveform with a modified final spin [54]. In current models, this co-precessing frame is either defined by the orbital dynamics [23, 37, 35], or by the optimal emission direction [27, 29], which is the direction in which majority of the power is emitted. Current “NRSurrogate” models instead use a co-orbital frame, which not only tracks the precession of the system using waveform quantities but also the instantaneous orbital phase, and interpolates numerical relativity waveforms in this frame [42].Report issue for preceding element In order to obtain the inertial frame waveform, a time- or frequency-dependent rotation is applied to the co-precessing waveform, e.g. see Refs. [25, 26, 50, 51, 27, 37]. This procedure is called ‘twisting-up’, and is performed with three time-/frequency-dependent Euler angles {α,β,γ}𝛼𝛽𝛾{alpha,beta,gamma}{ italic_α , italic_β , italic_γ }. Typically, these angles are chosen to describe the orientation of the co-precessing frame z𝑧zitalic_z direction with respect to the total angular momentum 𝑱𝑱bm{J}bold_italic_J.Report issue for preceding element In this paper, we investigate a source of systematic bias in precessing BBH waveforms affecting the ringdown section of the waveform. Ringdown is the final stage of a GW signal from a BBH system, where the system can be modeled as a single perturbed black hole emitting GWs. These GWs are characterised by a set of complex frequencies, called quasinormal modes (QNMs), where the real parts are the ringdown frequencies [55, 56]. Several works have shown complicated phenomenology in the ringdown for precessing BBH systems [57, 58, 59], which if mismodelled could lead to systematic bias in parameter estimation. The source of bias investigated here is due to employing the ringdown frequency derived from peturbation theory directly in the co-precessing frame, while the results from perturbation theory are only valid in the inertial 𝑱𝑱bm{J}bold_italic_J-frame [27, 58]. This mismodelling of co-precessing frame ringdown frequencies is present in many precessing models, such as IMRPhenomXPHM [23], and SEOBNRv4PHM [35]. In this paper we will study IMRPhenomXPHM, one of the key models employed by the LVK in the analysis of detected GW signals.Report issue for preceding element Understanding this source of systematic bias is relevant for both the data analysis of high mass precessing BBH systems, as well as for tests of GR which rely on the ringdown [5]. Several proposed tests of GR using GWs exist, and one such test is the Inspiral-Merger-Ringdown (IMR)-consistency test [60, 61]. The IMR-consistency test is based on GW data from a BBH merger. The fundamental concept underlying this test is that the mass and spin of the remnant black hole determined using two different segments of the GW signal, the inspiral (low-frequency) section and the ringdown (high-frequency) section, should be consistent [62]. Assuming accurate parameter estimation, lack of consistency indicates a potential GR violation.Report issue for preceding element Our analysis shows that mismodelling the co-precessing frame ringdown frequency leads to inaccuracies in GW data analysis. This is particularly so in highly precessing parameter space regions, especially at high values of mass ratio q𝑞qitalic_q, spin magnitude χ𝜒chiitalic_χ and spin misalignment with orbital angular momentum θ∼150⁢°similar-to𝜃150°\thetasim 150degreeitalic_θ ∼ 150 °. This will most strongly impact GW data analysis in two situations: first, when running parameter estimation on full signals from heavy mass systems, where the signal is dominated by the merger-ringdown; and second, when performing an IMR-consistency test. Our analysis shows one example of how mismodelling in the merger-ringdown portion of the signal can negatively impact parameter estimation and tests of GR.Report issue for preceding element We will first consider the impact of this source of systematic bias using Fisher analysis. This enables us to study the effect of this source of bias in isolation. We can therefore consider the impact not only on our ability to correctly measure the properties of the source from the GW signal, but also the consequent effect of these uncertainties on downstream analyses – in particular tests of GR. We will then consider a complete parameter estimation analysis. This will give a more realistic picture of the impact on GW data analysis. However, this analysis is less controlled and does not permit the investigation of a single source of waveform systematics. We therefore consider only the effect on parameter estimation and leave considerations of tests of GR to future, improved models.Report issue for preceding element The structure of this work is as follows. In Sec. II.1, we introduce the source of systematic bias under investigation in more detail. We then introduce the IMR-consistency test and the Fisher matrix formalism in Sec. II.2 and Sec. II.3, as these are the main tools for our analysis. In Sec. III, we discuss the the methodology of our analysis, before presenting results across parameter space. Finally, in Sec. IV, we perform signal injections and recovery using Bayesian analysis, to determine the effect of this bias on real parameter estimation.Report issue for preceding element II PreliminariesReport issue for preceding element In general, a quasi-circular BBH system composed of two black holes with masses m1subscript𝑚1m_{1}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and m2subscript𝑚2m_{2}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be described by 8 intrinsic parameters.

We will need signals of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 100 or more to make individual spin measurements, so we neglect two-spin effects for now [21]. For the rest of this paper, we consider only single-spin systems, where the more massive black hole has a spin, and the less massive black hole does not. In addition, we choose the convention where m1≥m2subscript𝑚1subscript𝑚2m_{1}geq m_{2}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≥ italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and thus q≥1𝑞1qgeq 1italic_q ≥ 1. The single spin on the larger black hole is described by two parameters, its magnitude χ𝜒chiitalic_χ, and the angle it makes with 𝑳𝑳bm{L}bold_italic_L, θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ. The parameter space we work with is thus (q,χ,θ)𝑞𝜒𝜃(q,chi,\theta)( italic_q , italic_χ , italic_θ ).Report issue for preceding element II.1 Modelling ringdown in precessing BBH systemsReport issue for preceding element GWs are often decomposed into harmonics, which provide a useful basis for modelling the radiation pattern. However, the choice of harmonics depends on the nature of the source. GWs produced by the inspiral phase of a binary system are more conveniently modelled using spherical harmonics, while GWs produced by a black hole ‘ringing down’ are best decomposed into spheroidal harmonics [19, 24, 66, 58]. It is common practice to decompose the full IMR signal into spherical harmonics [19, 67].Report issue for preceding element QNMs comprising the ringdown signal are uniquely determined by the mass and spin of the final black hole. The spin s𝑠sitalic_s-weighted QNM frequencies ωl⁢m⁢nsubscript𝜔𝑙𝑚𝑛omega_{lmn}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l italic_m italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, associated with projections onto spheroidal harmonics, are characterised by their angular number l𝑙litalic_l and azimuthal angle m𝑚mitalic_m. We consider only contributions from the fundamental QNMs (n=0𝑛0n=0italic_n = 0) [58]. For the rest of this paper the imaginary part Im⁢(ωl⁢m)Imsubscript𝜔𝑙𝑚\textrm{Im}(omega_{lm})Im ( italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) is not relevant to us. When we refer to ωl⁢msubscript𝜔𝑙𝑚omega_{lm}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from here onward, we are referring only to the real part Re⁢(ωl⁢m)Resubscript𝜔𝑙𝑚\textrm{Re}(omega_{lm})Re ( italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). In addition, we make the assumption that for the dominant (2,|2|)22(2,|2|)( 2 , | 2 | ) multipole in the co-precessing frame, we can use the spheroidal characteristic QNM frequency to characterise the frequency in the spherical harmonic basis.Report issue for preceding element As discussed in the Introduction, precessing waveform models employ a co-precessing frame model, which is then twisted up to an inertial frame waveform model using the Euler angles (α,β,γ)𝛼𝛽𝛾(alpha,beta,gamma)( italic_α , italic_β , italic_γ ). The angle β𝛽betaitalic_β is related to the opening angle of the precession cone during the inspiral [53, 68]. During the ringdown, β𝛽betaitalic_β is given by the orientation of the final spin relative to the optimal emission direction postmerger [58]. For further discussion on QNMs, see [66], and for further discussion on the direction of emission for GWs from a perturbed black hole, see Sec. IX.B of [27].Report issue for preceding element The rotation from the co-precessing frame to the inertial frame will introduce a shift in GW frequency, and since a rotation is still applied to the ringdown section of the waveform model, this means a shift in ringdown frequency [27].

The final model in the inertial frame will then have the wrong ringdown frequency. This is the case in some current and historical models, e.g. [23, 35], and has been corrected in more recent models [29, 27, 37]. In the rest of this paper, we investigate how this source of bias will affect data analysis using IMRPhenomXPHM.Report issue for preceding element In the construction of the merger-ringdown section of IMRPhenomXPHM, the final mass and spin of the remnant (Mf,χf)subscript𝑀𝑓subscript𝜒𝑓(M_{f},chi_{f})( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) are calculated using fits to numerical relativity (NR) and a correction to the final spin due to precessional effects [23]. The associated QNMs for these remnant parameters are then incorrectly employed in constructing the co-precessing frame ringdown waveform. As described above with Eq. (3), the final ωl⁢msubscript𝜔𝑙𝑚omega_{lm}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT value (once rotated back to the inertial frame) will thus be wrong, having been shifted away from its true value. This inappropriate choice of co-precessing frame QNM frequency introduces systematic bias in the merger-ringdown section of the waveform model, which could lead to inaccurate parameter estimation results. In particular, data analysis of high mass precessing BBH systems will be affected, since more of the ringdown section of the signal will be in the LVK sensitivity band.Report issue for preceding element It is important to understand where in parameter space these effects are most prominent, as we should be cautious with parameter estimation results in these regions. Tests of GR, including the IMR-consistency test, will also be affected. We anticipate this to be extreme regions of parameter space, with high values of q𝑞qitalic_q and χ𝜒chiitalic_χ, where precessional effects are more pronounced. Naively, we might expect that the effects of precession are maximised when the initial binary spins are fully in-plane, which would correspond to θ=90⁢°𝜃90°\theta=90degreeitalic_θ = 90 °. However, this systematic bias is actually maximised at θ≈150⁢°𝜃150°\thetaapprox 150degreeitalic_θ ≈ 150 °. This corresponds roughly to where cos⁡(βf)≈0subscript𝛽𝑓0cos(beta_{f})approx 0roman_cos ( italic_β start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ≈ 0, as can be seen from Fig. 6 and the surrounding discussion in Ref. [58]. This would maximise the shift away from the true QNM ringdown frequency in Eq. (3).Report issue for preceding element Physically, this can be understood as follows. Ref. [27] found, using NR data, that β𝛽betaitalic_β collapses through merger, rapidly dropping to a lower value. During inspiral, the precession cone (as measured by β𝛽betaitalic_β) will be largest for large in-plane spins, where θ∼90∘similar-to𝜃superscript90\thetasim 90^{circ}italic_θ ∼ 90 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∘ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. For systems with higher mass ratios and close to anti-aligned-spins, β𝛽betaitalic_β can take values greater than 90∘superscript9090^{circ}90 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∘ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, although the precession cone is bounded by 90∘superscript9090^{circ}90 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∘ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT due to symmetry about the orbital plane. For these systems, as β𝛽betaitalic_β collapses it moves closer to a value of 90∘superscript9090^{circ}90 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∘ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, and the precession cone actually increases, meaning that precession effects are maximal for these systems during merger and ringdown. Thus, the optimal emission direction, which corresponds to the direction of the perturbation of the remnant [58], will be close to orthogonal with final spin. The effect will thus be most pronounced for high values of θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ, excluding θ≊180⁢°approximately-equals-or-equals𝜃180°\thetaapproxeq 180degreeitalic_θ ≊ 180 °, which will just stay close to anti-aligned with the final spin.Report issue for preceding element II.2 IMR-Consistency TestReport issue for preceding element Various tests of GR using GWs have been proposed [69]. One such test is the IMR-consistency test [60, 61], which checks for consistency between two sections of the GW signal.Report issue for preceding element For the inspiral, which is the low-frequency part of the signal, initial masses and spins are first estimated using parameter estimation. These are then converted to remnant parameters using NR fits. The remnant parameters can also be similarly inferred from the post-merger, high-frequency part of the signal. These two sets of parameters are then compared. Assuming an accurate parameter estimation, we expect the two sets of estimates to be consistent with each other if GR is valid, and an inconsistency indicates a potential deviation from GR [60, 61].Report issue for preceding element To have sufficient SNR in each of the sections of the waveform, the full signal is used, split into two at an appropriate cutoff frequency. This is in contrast to the original idea, which was to use part of the signal from the early inspiral, and part of the signal from the ringdown. The frequency typically chosen is fISCOsubscript𝑓ISCOf_{\textrm{ISCO}}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ISCO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [60], which corresponds to twice the orbital frequency of a test particle orbiting at the innermost stable circular orbit of the remnant black hole formed by the system [70, 61, 60]. The frequency fISCOsubscript𝑓ISCOf_{\textrm{ISCO}}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ISCO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is not exactly the point where the inspiral regime moves to the merger regime, but it is a reasonable choice [71, 60].Report issue for preceding element The mismodelling of the co-precessing ringdown frequency discussed in Sec. II.1 means that the ringdown waveform is inconsistent with the inspiral waveform. If such a model is used for an IMR-consistency test on precessing systems, this bias will lead to inconsistencies that are unphysical. To analyse this issue across parameter space, we assess the consistency of the inspiral and ringdown portions of the IMRPhenomXPHM model by extracting properties directly from the waveforms. We determine whether the two estimates agree to within a given number of standard deviations. To calculate this error, we use the Fisher-matrix formalism.Report issue for preceding element II.3 Fisher matrix formalismReport issue for preceding element When a GW passes through a detector, the recorded data s⁢(t)𝑠𝑡s(t)italic_s ( italic_t ) isReport issue for preceding element s⁢(t)=h⁢(t)+n⁢(t),𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑡𝑛𝑡s(t)=h(t)+n(t),italic_s ( italic_t ) = italic_h ( italic_t ) + italic_n ( italic_t ) , (4) where h⁢(t)ℎ𝑡h(t)italic_h ( italic_t ) is the GW strain, and n⁢(t)𝑛𝑡n(t)italic_n ( italic_t ) is the noise present during the detection.

(14) III IMR-Consistency Test StudyReport issue for preceding element In this Section, we conduct an ‘IMR-consistency test’ on waveforms generated by the IMRPhenomXPHM model. Our goal here is to investigate the source of systematic bias described in Sec. II.1, and to determine the region of parameter space where it will affect data analysis.Report issue for preceding element We begin by generating a waveform instance for a given binary configuration with specific input inspiral parameters using PyCBC [76]. We then split the waveform instance into two sections at an appropriate cutoff frequency, which we choose to be fISCOsubscript𝑓ISCOf_{\textrm{ISCO}}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ISCO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [77, 78]. For each of our two sections of the waveform, we employ distinct methods to estimate the parameters of the remnant black hole (Mf,χf)subscript𝑀𝑓subscript𝜒𝑓(M_{f},chi_{f})( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), followed by calculating the error ellipses using the Fisher matrix formalism. We choose to employ the Fisher matrix formalism as we want to conduct our analysis across parameter space, and thus need a computationally efficient method.Report issue for preceding element If the ellipses for a particular confidence interval do not overlap, it indicates that the final parameters estimated from the two sections of our waveform are incompatible with each other up to that confidence level. In accordance with the IMR-consistency test criteria, this result implies a ‘violation of GR’. Since the model is intended to faithfully represent a GW signal as predicted by GR, this violation is non-physical and comes from inaccuracies in the waveform model.Report issue for preceding element The Fisher analysis enables us to identify the regions of parameter space where model inaccuracies will lead to this erroneous conclusion, due to systematic biases. We explore the parameter space described by (q,χ,θ)𝑞𝜒𝜃(q,chi,\theta)( italic_q , italic_χ , italic_θ ). We conduct our analysis across this parameter space for waveforms with specific SNR values, and look for predicted ‘violations of GR’ at 1⁢σ1𝜎1sigma1 italic_σ, 2⁢σ2𝜎2sigma2 italic_σ and 3⁢σ3𝜎3sigma3 italic_σ confidence levels.Report issue for preceding element III.1 Calculating Remnant ParametersReport issue for preceding element III.1.1 InspiralReport issue for preceding element The inspiral part of the waveform is characterised by the input intrinsic parameters. We can calculate the values of (Mf,χf)subscript𝑀𝑓subscript𝜒𝑓(M_{f},chi_{f})( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) predicted for a binary with these input parameters using fits obtained from NR simulations.Report issue for preceding element We follow the method that IMRPhenomXPHM uses to model the final state of a precessing system given the input inspiral parameters (c.f. Section IV.D of [23]). For inspiral parameters (q,χ,θ)𝑞𝜒𝜃(q,chi,\theta)( italic_q , italic_χ , italic_θ ), we first find the final state (Mf∥,χf∥)superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑓parallel-tosuperscriptsubscript𝜒𝑓parallel-to(M_{f}^{parallel},chi_{f}^{parallel})( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∥ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∥ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) of the corresponding aligned-spin system parameterised by (q,χ⁢cos⁡θ,0)𝑞𝜒𝜃0(q,chicos\theta,0)( italic_q , italic_χ roman_cos italic_θ , 0 ), using the NR fits from [79]. These fits are implemented using code from package llondon6/positive [80]. We then employ approximations to obtain the final state of the precessing system [23].Report issue for preceding element For the final mass, several NR fit studies have shown that there is only a weak dependence on precession [81, 82, 83]. Thus, we follow IMRPhenomXPHM and its predecessors in setting Mf=Mf∥subscript𝑀𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑓parallel-toM_{f}=M_{f}^{parallel}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∥ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.Report issue for preceding element For the final spin, we cannot ignore precession dependence [23].

(16) We will denote these final mass and spin values calculated from the inspiral section as (Mfinsp,χfinsp)subscriptsuperscript𝑀insp𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝜒insp𝑓(M^{\textrm{insp}}_{f},chi^{\textrm{insp}}_{f})( italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT insp end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT insp end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ).Report issue for preceding element III.1.2 Merger-RingdownReport issue for preceding element Now we compute the remnant parameters from the post-merger section of our waveform, which we denote (Mfmerg,χfmerg)subscriptsuperscript𝑀merg𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝜒merg𝑓(M^{\textrm{merg}}_{f},chi^{\textrm{merg}}_{f})( italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT merg end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT merg end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). This computation is more complicated than the inspiral equivalent above – since the IMRPhenomXPHM waveforms are generated with inspiral input parameters, we need to extract the parameters directly from the generated merger-ringdown waveform. As discussed above, NR studies have shown the final mass value has a weak dependence on precession. We thus take Mfmerg=Mfinspsubscriptsuperscript𝑀merg𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝑀insp𝑓M^{\textrm{merg}}_{f}=M^{\textrm{insp}}_{f}italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT merg end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT insp end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and assume that the source of bias outlined in Sec II.1 will affect only χfsubscript𝜒𝑓chi_{f}italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. This assumption allows us to estimate the final spin χfmergsuperscriptsubscript𝜒𝑓mergchi_{f}^{mathrm{merg}}italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_merg end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT from the merger-ringdown section.Report issue for preceding element To accomplish this, we analyse the QNM spectrum of the final black hole. In particular, we want to extract the characteristic ringdown frequency ω22subscript𝜔22omega_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of the (2,|2|)22(2,|2|)( 2 , | 2 | ) mode. Using QNM data tables [66], which list ωl⁢msubscript𝜔𝑙𝑚omega_{lm}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT values for corresponding black hole masses and spins, we can then compute χfsubscript𝜒𝑓chi_{f}italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.Report issue for preceding element We generally expect a characteristic dip in the phase derivative of the aligned-spin waveform at frequency f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. This dip frequency coincides up to a small error with the ringdown frequency of the final black hole for an aligned-spin system, ω22subscript𝜔22omega_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [17, 18, 24]. Across parameter space, the behaviour of the phase derivative of the (2,|2|)22(2,|2|)( 2 , | 2 | ) mode is relatively well behaved for aligned-spin systems, and for precessing systems in the co-precessing frame. However, trying to search for this dip in the inertial frame phase derivative of a precessing waveform is not trivial, due to the mixing of spherical multipoles caused by the twisting up procedure [58]. As precession effects grow, the behaviour of the phase derivative is less well-behaved.Report issue for preceding element Report issue for preceding element Report issue for preceding element Figure 1: Two figures demonstrating our search for ω22subscript𝜔22omega_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, one in the co-precessing frame (above), and one in the inertial frame (below). The dotted lines show the determined ω22subscript𝜔22omega_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Report issue for preceding element We first find an estimate of ω22subscript𝜔22omega_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT using the predicted remnant mass and spin values calculated in Sec. III.1.1, and then computationally search for the characteristic dip in d⁢ϕ22/d⁢f𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ22𝑑𝑓dphi_{22}/dfitalic_d italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_d italic_f in a window around this estimate. An example of such a search, in both the co-precessing frame and the inertial frame, can be seen in Fig. 1. Our results for ω22subscript𝜔22omega_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are relatively noisy for high q𝑞qitalic_q, χ𝜒chiitalic_χ and θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ values. In order to analyse general trends across parameter space, we generate ω22⁢(θ)subscript𝜔22𝜃omega_{22}(\theta)italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_θ ) values across θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ parameter space for each {q,χ}𝑞𝜒{q,chi}{ italic_q , italic_χ } used in the analysis, and perform a cubic fit through these values. The QNM frequency we use is then the value of this fit at our input θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ.Report issue for preceding element To convert this QNM frequency into final spin, we create a spline from the QNM data tables [66], inputting ω22subscript𝜔22omega_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Mfmergsubscriptsuperscript𝑀merg𝑓M^{\textrm{merg}}_{f}italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT merg end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to obtain |χfmerg|subscriptsuperscript𝜒merg𝑓|chi^{\textrm{merg}}_{f}|| italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT merg end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT |.

Note that we are not yet considering any statistical errors in our estimates of the remnant parameters – that is something we will look at next in Sec. III.2.Report issue for preceding element The results here agree with our expectations that the difference in estimates will be more pronounced for extreme regions in parameter space. For q=4𝑞4q=4italic_q = 4, the two spin estimates agree generally, while for q=11𝑞11q=11italic_q = 11, there is a dramatic increase in |Δ⁢χf|Δsubscript𝜒𝑓|Deltachi_{f}|| roman_Δ italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | at high χ,θ𝜒𝜃chi,\thetaitalic_χ , italic_θ values. This is what we expect – as precession effects become more relevant, the shift in the ringdown frequency should increase, leading to a greater difference.Report issue for preceding element III.2 Computing Errors in Remnant ParametersReport issue for preceding element For each (q,χ,θ)𝑞𝜒𝜃(q,chi,\theta)( italic_q , italic_χ , italic_θ ) input, we calculate the uncertainties in measurements of (Mf,χf)subscript𝑀𝑓subscript𝜒𝑓(M_{f},chi_{f})( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) from both parts of the waveform for a signal at a given SNR. We do this using the Fisher matrix formalism detailed in Sec. II.3, calculating the 3-dimensional Fisher matrix Eq. (8) for both the inspiral and for the merger-ringdown. We use numerical derivative methods to calculate the derivatives of the final parameters with respect to the input parameters. This is trivial for the inspiral, as the input parameters are simply the inspiral parameters. For the merger, this is more complicated. For example, for calculating the derivative of Mfmergsubscriptsuperscript𝑀merg𝑓M^{\textrm{merg}}_{f}italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT merg end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with respect to q𝑞qitalic_q, we repeat the entire analysis detailed in Section III.1.2 for q+δ⁢q𝑞𝛿𝑞q+delta qitalic_q + italic_δ italic_q, and for q−δ⁢q𝑞𝛿𝑞q-delta qitalic_q - italic_δ italic_q, and perform a numerical derivative.Report issue for preceding element Having obtained the 2-dimensional covariance matrix of the remnant parameters, following the analysis in Sec. II.3 to obtain Eq. (9), we can then compute the error ellipses for the final mass and spin. Putting all above results together, we perform an IMR-consistency test on the waveform model IMRPhenomXPHM across a large region of parameter space.Report issue for preceding element (a) Consistent at 1,2121,21 , 2 and 3⁢σ3𝜎3sigma3 italic_σ.

Report issue for preceding element (c) Inconsistent at 1,2121,21 , 2 and 3⁢σ3𝜎3sigma3 italic_σ. Report issue for preceding element Figure 3: Fisher formalism IMR-consistency analysis results for 1, 2 and 3σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ confidence levels are shown in the figure. The input inspiral parameters are displayed at the top of each figure. The recovered parameters (Mf,χf)subscript𝑀𝑓subscript𝜒𝑓(M_{f},chi_{f})( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) from the inspiral and merger-ringdown of the waveform are marked with ‘x’ points, and the error ellipses, calculated using the Fisher matrix method, are plotted centered on these points. Consistency between the inspiral and merger-ringdown spin estimates at a specific confidence level occurs if the the error ellipses generated by the two sections overlap. Results demonstrating consistency at 3⁢σ3𝜎3sigma3 italic_σ level are highlighted with a yellow background, while inconsistency is denoted by a blue background. Report issue for preceding element III.3 Results of analysis across parameter spaceReport issue for preceding element Our findings reveal that the model incorrectly predicts violations of GR in more extreme regions of parameter space (i.e., high q𝑞qitalic_q, χ𝜒chiitalic_χ, and θ≈150⁢°𝜃150°\thetaapprox 150degreeitalic_θ ≈ 150 °), inline with our expectations described in Sec. II.1. We also see fewer predicted violations at lower SNR. This makes sense, as we expect our error ellipses to scale with 1/S⁢N⁢R1𝑆𝑁𝑅1/sqrt{SNR}1 / square-root start_ARG italic_S italic_N italic_R end_ARG [73]. If our error ellipses are larger, systematic bias effects are less pronounced. This also means that as SNR increases, we see violations across a larger region of parameter space, as for larger SNRs our error ellipses should be smaller.Report issue for preceding element Fig. 3 illustrates the results of our analysis for three specific cases, at different points from widely separated regions in parameter space to demonstrate the observed parameter space trend. We investigate at confidence levels of 1σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ, 2σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ, and 3σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ, plotting x⁢σ𝑥𝜎xsigmaitalic_x italic_σ error ellipses centered around the values estimated in Section III.1. In a standard IMR-consistency test, non-overlapping x⁢σ𝑥𝜎xsigmaitalic_x italic_σ error ellipses indicates a potential deviation from GR at x⁢σ𝑥𝜎xsigmaitalic_x italic_σ level. In our analysis here, such non-overlap would constitute an inconsistency in the model for the given input parameters, warranting caution in these specific parameter space regions.Report issue for preceding element Our results follow our expectations as outlined in Sec. II.1. The leftmost figure shows results for a weakly precessing system with low values of (q,χ,θ)𝑞𝜒𝜃(q,chi,\theta)( italic_q , italic_χ , italic_θ ), where even the 1⁢σ1𝜎1sigma1 italic_σ error ellipses overlap. Therefore, the model is consistent for this system. However, this is not the case for the other two configurations. The middle figure shows a system with (q=6,χ=0.5,θ=150⁢°)formulae-sequence𝑞6formulae-sequence𝜒0.5𝜃150°(q=6,chi=0.5,\theta=150degree)( italic_q = 6 , italic_χ = 0.5 , italic_θ = 150 ° ). Here, the model is consistent at 2222 and 3⁢σ3𝜎3sigma3 italic_σ level, but is inconsistent at 1⁢σ1𝜎1sigma1 italic_σ. The rightmost figure shows the most strongly precessing system with (q=7,χ=0.8,θ=150⁢°)formulae-sequence𝑞7formulae-sequence𝜒0.8𝜃150°(q=7,chi=0.8,\theta=150degree)( italic_q = 7 , italic_χ = 0.8 , italic_θ = 150 ° ). Here we see that the model predicts a violation at all σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ levels. We can clearly see that as we move towards more highly precessing systems, the deviation between the final spin estimate calculated using the two methods increases from 𝒪⁢(10−3)𝒪superscript103mathcal{O}(10^{-3})caligraphic_O ( 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) (left hand panel) to 𝒪⁢(10−1)𝒪superscript101mathcal{O}(10^{-1})caligraphic_O ( 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) (right hand panel). Therefore, although the fractional uncertainty estimate remains constant, the error ellipses are much more strongly separated in the case of a highly precessing system.Report issue for preceding element Having examined a few specific cases, we now aim to systematically explore trends across parameter space. To this end, we perform a similar analysis to the one described above for 28×28×28=21,9522828282195228\times 28\times 28=21,95228 × 28 × 28 = 21 , 952 points in parameter space. This analysis is conducted for a given total mass, SNR, and σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ level. Although most of the violation points appear in the region where we expect them, we still observe some scattered throughout the rest of parameter space. To identify general trends, we apply a noise reduction technique to our data.Report issue for preceding element (a) IMR-consistency test violation points at 3σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ, for systems with total mass M=70⁢M⊙𝑀70subscript𝑀direct-productM=70M_{odot}italic_M = 70 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and SNR =20absent20=20= 20.

Report issue for preceding element Figure 4: These plots illustrate the results of an IMR-consistency test analysis conducted across parameter space, for 28×28×2828282828\times 28\times 2828 × 28 × 28 points. The results are split into four bins depending on the χ𝜒chiitalic_χ input value. The radial axis shows q𝑞qitalic_q, and the angular axis shows θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ. In each χ𝜒chiitalic_χ bin, there are 7 possible χ𝜒chiitalic_χ points for each (q,θ)𝑞𝜃(q,\theta)( italic_q , italic_θ ). The plots here show the number of violations across χ𝜒chiitalic_χ for each (q,θ)𝑞𝜃(q,\theta)( italic_q , italic_θ ), in each bin, with the colour bar showing this number. We clearly see more violations for higher χ𝜒chiitalic_χ, and clustered around high q𝑞qitalic_q and θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ. From the difference between plots (a) and (b), we see the effect that SNR has on this analysis. Report issue for preceding element The results, as seen in Fig. 4, show violations in the high (q,χ,θ)𝑞𝜒𝜃(q,chi,\theta)( italic_q , italic_χ , italic_θ ) regions of parameter space as expected. We see that as each of the parameters gets closer to the region of expected violation (high q𝑞qitalic_q and χ𝜒chiitalic_χ, θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ approaching 150⁢°150°150degree150 °), there is an increased clustering of violation points. Comparing Fig. 4(a) to Fig. 4(b), we see that an increase in SNR correlates with a broader violation region.Report issue for preceding element We also performed this analysis for varying values of SNR, and at 1σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ, 2σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ, and 3σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ. In general, the region of parameter space in which we see inconsistencies at a given σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ increases for higher SNR. This result aligns with the expectation that increased uncertainty in our estimates, reflected by larger error ellipses, facilitates overlooking systematic biases. This also means that as our detectors become more sensitive, and we begin detecting highly precessing systems, this bias will be more significant.Report issue for preceding element IV Parameter EstimationReport issue for preceding element (a) Lower SNR injection, with SNR = 20. Report issue for preceding element (b) Higher SNR injection, with SNR = 60.

For both figures, the remnant mass is in units [M⊙subscript𝑀direct-productM_{odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT]. The predicted values are remnant parameters estimated from the two sections of the waveform, following analysis detailed in Sec. III.1.1 and Sec. III.1.2. The shaded regions show the 1⁢σ1𝜎1sigma1 italic_σ confidence regions. Report issue for preceding element In this section, we wish to investigate the effect of the systematic bias due to the mismodelling of ringdown frequency on a complete parameter estimation analysis. We seek to understand how parameter estimation may be biased, in particular for high mass systems where the merger and ringdown lie in the most sensitive part of the detector. We inject waveforms and run Bayesian analysis using parameter estimation pipelines. Attempts were also made to conduct IMR-consistency test injections and parameter estimation; however, the parameter recovery for the ringdown section was too poor to isolate the effects of the systematic bias under investigation.Report issue for preceding element Our injected waveform uses a modified version of IMRPhenomXPHM. IMRPhenomXPHM is built using the aligned-spin model IMRPhenomXHM [24] in the co-precessing frame, before applying a twisting-up procedure. In our analysis here, we use a version of IMRPhenomXPHM with an altered co-precessing frame model called XHM-CP [27, 29]. This modified version of the aligned spin model IMRPhenomXHM was used as part of the co-precessing frame model for the new precessing waveform model IMRPhenomXO4a [29]. XHM-CP shifts the QNM frequencies in the co-precessing frame, such that they are then accurately modelled in the inertial frame. Other small improvements are included in XHM-CP to improve the accuracy of the model as a whole, mainly affecting the late inspiral-merger section of the model. The dominant change in this co-precessing frame model is the ringdown frequencies, and we thus expect our analysis here to reflect specifically the effect of mismodelling the co-precessing ringdown frequency. We call this version of IMRPhenomXPHM with the correct shifted QNM frequency XPHM-FS.Report issue for preceding element We inject waveforms using XPHM-FS, and then recover parameters using both XPHM-FS and XPHM, models—the latter still containing the mismodelled QNM frequencies. This parameter estimation is done on the full waveform, instead of a waveform split in two sections for an IMR-consistency test. Given the computational intensity of this analysis, it was conducted on a limited number of configurations. In total, we performed injections for eight sets of intrinsic parameters (q,χ,θ)𝑞𝜒𝜃(q,chi,\theta)( italic_q , italic_χ , italic_θ ), which were {(3,0.2,0⁢°),(3,0.2,60⁢°),(3,0.2,90⁢°),(3,0.8,90⁢°),(3,0.8,150⁢°),(8,0.2,60⁢°),(8,0.8,90⁢°),(8,0.8,150⁢°)}30.20°30.260°30.290°30.890°30.8150°80.260°80.890°80.8150°{(3,0.2,0degree),(3,0.2,60degree),(3,0.2,90degree),(3,0.8,90degree), (3,0.8,150degree),(8,0.2,60degree),(8,0.8,90degree),(8,0.8,150degree)}{ ( 3 , 0.2 , 0 ° ) , ( 3 , 0.2 , 60 ° ) , ( 3 , 0.2 , 90 ° ) , ( 3 , 0.8 , 90 ° ) , ( 3 , 0.8 , 150 ° ) , ( 8 , 0.2 , 60 ° ) , ( 8 , 0.8 , 90 ° ) , ( 8 , 0.8 , 150 ° ) }. For each of these parameters, we injected at total mass 70⁢M⊙70subscript𝑀direct-product70M_{odot}70 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and 100⁢M⊙100subscript𝑀direct-product100M_{odot}100 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and at SNRs 20 and 60. The full set of parameters used for the injection analysis shown in Fig. 5 is listed in Table 1. The extrinsic parameters were constant for all configurations considered. For each of the injections, we considered a three detector network, LIGO Livingston, LIGO Hanford, and VIRGO. The corresponding advanced design sensitivity curve were used for each of these detectors [8, 9, 10].Report issue for preceding element The choice of total mass 70⁢M⊙70subscript𝑀direct-product70M_{odot}70 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT means that the ringdown frequency of the waveform is close to 100 - 200 Hz, which is the most sensitive frequency band of the LIGO and VIRGO detectors [8, 9, 10]. For systems with a high total mass such as this, the ringdown section of the signal will dominate our data, and mismodelling in the ringdown section will then greatly affect our parameter estimation results.Report issue for preceding element Right ascension, declination, polarisation, and inclination were chosen to ensure that the power in the plus and cross polarisations is approximately equal, enhancing the measurability of precession. Specifically, our goal was to achieve a ratio close to 1, expressed as ∑dF+,d2/∑dF×,d2∼1similar-tosubscript𝑑subscriptsuperscript𝐹2𝑑subscript𝑑subscriptsuperscript𝐹2𝑑1sqrt{sum_{d}{F^{2}_{+,d}/sum_{d}F^{2}_{\times,d}}}sim 1square-root start_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_F start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT + , italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_F start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT × , italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ∼ 1, where d𝑑ditalic_d represents the detectors. The choice of inclination was also optimised to maximise the observability of precession [87, 88].Report issue for preceding element We then performed Bayesian inference via the Bilby parameter estimation software package [89, 90] employing the Dynesty nested sampler [91] with 1000 live points and broad, uninformative priors. The injections and parameter estimation were performed using tools from yumeng.xu/GWUtils [92] on the LIGO Hawk computing cluster. The results were then processed and visualized using the pesummary package [93], which also facilitated the conversion of inspiral parameter posteriors to remnant parameter posteriors.Report issue for preceding element Total Mass M𝑀Mitalic_M[M⊙subscript𝑀direct-productM_{odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT] 70 Mass Ratio q𝑞qitalic_q 3.0 Spin Magnitude χ𝜒chiitalic_χ 0.8 Spin Inclination θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ[°] 150 Right ascension α𝛼alphaitalic_α 0.254 Declination δ𝛿deltaitalic_δ -0.111 Polarisation ΨΨPsiroman_Ψ 4.697 Inclination ι𝜄iotaitalic_ι 0.6 Table 1: Parameters of the injection for results shown in Fig. 5. Report issue for preceding element Our injections range from aligned-spin to highly precessing systems, and in particular systems with high spin magnitudes and θ≈150⁢°𝜃150°\thetaapprox 150degreeitalic_θ ≈ 150 °. The results of our parameter estimation are largely aligned with our expectations. For the q=3𝑞3q=3italic_q = 3 systems, the aligned spin and close to aligned spin systems showed good agreement between remnant parameter posteriors estimated from inspiral and merger-ringdown. As the spin magnitude χ𝜒chiitalic_χ and angle θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ increase, discrepancies in the estimated remnant parameters become more pronounced, reaching a peak in the system outlined in Table 1. Systems with q=8𝑞8q=8italic_q = 8 also exhibited some discrepancies in the estimated remnant parameters, exceeding the anticipated levels due to inaccuracies in modelling the ringdown frequency. This suggests that other systematics, such as the mismodelling of precessional dynamics through merger and ringdown, dominate the results such that we are unable to identify the impact of a given sources of systematic bias.Report issue for preceding element The findings of the analysis for the system described in Table 1 are illustrated in Fig. 5, which shows parameter estimation results at SNRs of 20 and 60. The remnant mass posteriors for the two models agree at 1σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ, further justifying our assumption that Mfinsp=Mfmergsuperscriptsubscript𝑀𝑓inspsuperscriptsubscript𝑀𝑓mergM_{f}^{\textrm{insp}}=M_{f}^{\textrm{merg}}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT insp end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT merg end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. In this figure, the ‘Prediction (NR fits)’ line on the right correspond to the true injected value calculated from NR fits, while the ‘Biased prediction’ line corresponds to the wrong value that we expect the mismodelling of the ringdown frequency to give. At lower SNR, shown in Fig. 5(a), we see that both models recover the true injected value to 1σ𝜎sigmaitalic_σ confidence. However, at a higher SNR of 60, depicted in Fig. 5(b), the disparity between the two posteriors for the final spin becomes evident, with XPHM failing to accurately recover the true injected value within the 1⁢σ1𝜎1sigma1 italic_σ range, leaning instead towards the biased predicted value. This highlights the systematic bias that will occur when performing parameter estimation with any waveform model with this mismodelling of the ringdown frequency.Report issue for preceding element The majority of events detected thus far have shown no clear evidence of precession and are at lower SNRs, belonging to the region of parameter space where we do not see biases from mismodelling this ringdown frequency. In the future, we expect the effects of this mismodelling to be relevant as detectors become increasingly sensitive and we begin to see unambiguously precessing signals.Report issue for preceding element V ConclusionReport issue for preceding element With the ongoing observing run of the LVK [94], we anticipate the detection of a significant number of GW events with higher SNRs than previously seen. Additionally, we expect to observe signals from systems with considerable precession. It is crucial to pinpoint the limitations of our current waveform models to properly interpret this influx of data.Report issue for preceding element In this work, we explored a source of systematic bias stemming from the inaccurate calculation of the co-precessing frame QNM frequency ω22CPsubscriptsuperscript𝜔CP22omega^{\textrm{CP}}_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT CP end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, which results in an erroneous final inertial frame QNM frequency ω22Jsubscriptsuperscript𝜔𝐽22omega^{J}_{22}italic_ω start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_J end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 22 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and consequently, incorrect phenomenology in the post-merger waveform. We considered IMRPhenomXPHM, a highly computationally efficient waveform model currently being used for data analysis. We identified the regions of the parameter space where this bias is strongest: namely where (q,χ)𝑞𝜒(q,chi)( italic_q , italic_χ ) are high, and θ∼150⁢°similar-to𝜃150°\thetasim 150degreeitalic_θ ∼ 150 °. Though the exact points of parameter space where this mismodelling is relevant is waveform model dependent, we expect the general picture to be model independent.Report issue for preceding element We examined the bias in the context of the IMR-consistency test by using the Fisher matrix formalism, checking whether the predicted remnant spin χfsubscript𝜒𝑓chi_{f}italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from the waveform model itself was consistent between inspiral and merger-ringdown portions of the waveform. The computational efficiency of the Fisher matrix formalism enabled us to run this analysis across the entire parameter space. Our results demonstrated discrepancies between the inspiral and merger-ringdown sections of the model, for high values of (q,χ)𝑞𝜒(q,chi)( italic_q , italic_χ ), and θ∼150⁢°similar-to𝜃150°\thetasim 150degreeitalic_θ ∼ 150 ° as expected. We found that the discrepancies are greater at larger SNR.Report issue for preceding element Additionally, we found that employing models that do not correctly account for the effect of precession in the ringdown frequency can lead to biased parameter estimation results, which is particlarly significant at higher SNRs.Report issue for preceding element In conclusion, our results have shown how failing to correctly account for all physical effects can lead to waveform systematics that negatively impact both parameter estimation and tests of GR. Here we have focused on precession effects in the merger-ringdown portion of the signal. The majority of currently available waveform models for use in analysis do not completely model precession through merger and ringdown accurately. In addition, we are yet to have full GR-informed models that account for both precession and eccentricity, which will add further biases in parameter estimation.Report issue for preceding element VI AcknowledgementsReport issue for preceding element The authors of this paper would like to thank Shubhanshu Tiwari, Yumeng Xu, Philippe Jetzer, Héctor Estellés, Peter James Nee, Nihar Gupte, Raj Patil, and Elisa Maggio for useful discussions.
