The study investigates the essential role of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex LolCDE in Escherichia coli, particularly its function in the release of outer membrane lipoproteins from the inner membrane. Researchers constructed a conditional null mutant of the lolCDE genes, which was lethal for E. coli when depleted of LolCDE at a nonpermissive temperature. The results demonstrated that both LolC and LolE are necessary for the growth of E. coli and for the proper localization of lipoproteins. The study confirmed that the LolCDE complex is the sole apparatus responsible for the release of lipoproteins, as depletion of this complex led to mislocalization of lipoproteins in the inner membrane without affecting their translocation across the inner membrane. The findings highlight the critical function of the LolCDE complex in lipoprotein sorting and underscore its importance as an essential ABC transporter in E. coli.
